List down the commands for each step. Starting at step 3

Step 2: In MongoDB Compass, create a new database called "Bookstore" and a collection called "Books".

Step 3: Perform the following CRUD operations using MongoDB Compass:

a) Create Operation:
Insert at least three book documents with different fields such as title, author, genre, and publication year.
Ans:
db.Books.insertMany([
    {
        title: "Pride and Prejudice", author: "Jane Austen", genre: "Romance", publicationYear: 1813
    },
    {
        title: "1984", author: "George Orwell", genre: "Dystopian", publicationYear: 1949
    },
    {
        title: "To Kill a Mockingbird", author: "Harper Lee", genre: "Southern Gothic", publicationYear: 1960
    },
]);
Note should be an array of documents inserted in []


b) Read Operation:
Retrieve all the book documents in the "Books" collection.
Ans:
db.Books.find();

Retrieve a specific book document based on its title or author.
Ans:
Find a book with the word 'and' in its title 
db.Books.find({title: {$regex: "and"}}, {_id: 0});

c) Update Operation:
Update the genre of a book document.
db.Books.updateOne({title: "Pride and Prejudice"}, {$set: {genre: "Horror"}})

Update the publication year of a book document.
db.Books.updateOne({title: "Pride and Prejudice"}, {$set: {publicationYear: 2000}})

d) Delete Operation:
Delete a book document based on its title or author.
"To delete a book with the word "and" in its title"
db.Books.deleteOne({title: {$regex: "and"}})

Step 4: After each operation, verify the changes by re-reading the data from the "Books" collection.

Note: Remember to clean up the cluster and delete the "Bookstore" database if no longer needed.
